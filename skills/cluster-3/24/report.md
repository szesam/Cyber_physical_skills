## Summary
Setup PWM control for LED intensity using duty cycle.
1. Follow example given by ESP32 LEDC example project.
2. Conver example project to accept user input and change duty cycle accordingly.
3. Write duty cycle function to step up and down in intensity when user called 'cycle'.
3. Build, flash, take video
